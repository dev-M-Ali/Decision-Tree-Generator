# Decision Tree Generator

Often, I found it useful to analyze situations using decision trees (well, mostly, graphs in my case) to make a decision. Keeping that in mind, I thought to create a simple web-app to create decision trees using LLMs.

Therefore, we present to you our Decision Tree Generator: A simple web application that transforms complex decisions into clear, visual decision trees using AI. Built with React and powered by OpenRouter's AI models.
